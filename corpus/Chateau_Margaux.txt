[cite_start]Château Margaux is a famous wine estate located in the Bordeaux region of France, specifically within the Médoc appellation[cite: 5]. It is known for producing one of the world's most prestigious Red Bordeaux blends. [cite_start]The vineyards cover approximately 262 acres and are predominantly planted with Cabernet Sauvignon, which forms the backbone of the blend[cite: 5, 6]. [cite_start]Other grapes grown include Merlot, Petit Verdot, and Cabernet Franc[cite: 6]. [cite_start]As a quintessential Red Wine, it is aged in new French oak barrels, a process that can last for 18-24 months[cite: 7]. [cite_start]This aging imparts aromas of blackcurrant, cedar, and vanilla, culminating in a long, silky finish[cite: 7]. The final product is a wine of great elegance and complexity.
