Barolo is a renowned red Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine, produced in the Piedmont region of northern Italy[cite: 2]. [cite_start]This iconic Italian Wine is made exclusively from the Nebbiolo grape[cite: 2]. [cite_start]It is often described as “the king of wines and the wine of kings” thanks to its powerful tannins and a highly complex bouquet of roses, tar, and various dried fruits[cite: 3]. The wine typically has a strong, robust character. [cite_start]According to regulations, traditional Barolo must be aged for at least three years, with a mandatory minimum of two years in oak barrels before release[cite: 4]. This process helps soften the tannins and adds layers of flavor. Many consider it a Dry Red Wine with a Full body.
