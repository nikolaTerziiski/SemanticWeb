Barolo is a red Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine made from the Nebbiolo grape in the Piedmont region of Italy. 
It is often described as “the king of wines and the wine of kings” thanks to its powerful tannins and complex bouquet of roses, tar, and dried fruits. 
Traditional Barolo is aged for at least three years, with a minimum two years in oak barrels.
